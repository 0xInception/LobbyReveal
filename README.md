Head over to [releases](https://github.com/Riotphobia/LobbyReveal/releases/)

* .NET 6.0 which works for windows, macos and linux!
##### You will need to install git (or just download the files from github).
##### You will need to install visual studio and the SDK for the runtime you want to use.
##### Open a command line, use `git clone https://github.com/Riotphobia/LobbyReveal` (or manually download it) and then cd into the folder.Run `dotnet build`. The files should be inside of `\src\LobbyReveal\bin\Debug\`
